# Cindy Black's Portfolio
This portfolio site showcases my early web development work and was built on an HTML template from Pixelarity. While the template was built with responsiveness in mind, its age meant that accessibility needed to be refactored in.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This portfolio site was built on a responsive HTML template but needed significant refactoring to replace existing code with semantic HTML tags without altering the CSS styling.

## Optimizations
- Accessibility improvements to template
- removed deprecated code from CSS template

## Lessons Learned:
Templates are meant to save design time, but there may be a trade-off in time spent refactoring code for accessibiltiy and organization.
